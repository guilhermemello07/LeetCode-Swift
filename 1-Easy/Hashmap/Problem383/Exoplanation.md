# Explanation: Ransom Note

## Problem Description
You are given two strings, ransomNote and magazine. The task is to determine if it's possible to construct the ransomNote using the letters from magazine. Each letter in the magazine can only be used once in the ransomNote.

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dictionaries (hash maps) to keep track of the character counts for both ransomNote and magazine. Here's the step-by-step approach:

- First, we guard against the case where the length of ransomNote is greater than the length of magazine. If this is the case, it's impossible to construct ransomNote from magazine, so we return false immediately.

- We initialize two dictionaries, magazineDict and ransomDict, to store character counts. We will use these dictionaries to keep track of the counts of characters in the magazine and ransomNote, respectively.

- We iterate through each character in the magazine string and update magazineDict accordingly. If a character is already in the dictionary, we increment its count by 1; otherwise, we add it to the dictionary with a count of 1.

- Next, we iterate through each character in the ransomNote string and update ransomDict in the same way.

- Finally, we compare the character counts in both dictionaries. For each character in ransomDict, we check if it exists in magazineDict and if the count in magazineDict is greater than or equal to the count in ransomDict. If this condition holds true for all characters in ransomDict, we return true, indicating that it's possible to construct the ransomNote from the magazine. Otherwise, we return false.

## Example
Consider the example where ransomNote = "aa" and magazine = "aab":

- After constructing the dictionaries, magazineDict contains the counts: {"a": 2, "b": 1}, and ransomDict contains the counts: {"a": 2}.

- We compare the character counts:

  - For "a", magazineDict["a"] (2) is greater than or equal to ransomDict["a"] (2), which is true.
  - Since all characters in ransomDict can be constructed from magazineDict, we return true.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where n is the length of the ransomNote string, and m is the length of the magazine string. We iterate through both strings once to construct the dictionaries.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(k), where k is the number of distinct characters in the magazine. In the worst case, if all characters are distinct, the space complexity would be O(m).
