![LeetCodeLogoImage](https://github.com/guilhermemello07/LeetCode-Swift/assets/72673965/7377c348-9c3a-4927-9958-fbf692abf73d)

Welcome to my LeetCode problem solutions repository! This GitHub repository contains all of my solutions to various LeetCode problems, coded in Swift. I believe that tackling LeetCode problems is an excellent way to hone your coding and algorithmic skills, and I'm excited to share my solutions with fellow programmers. Each solution includes a comprehensive explanation of the approach I took.

## Introduction
LeetCode is a renowned platform that presents a diverse collection of coding challenges. These challenges are invaluable for interview preparation and skill enhancement. This repository documents my journey through these challenges, providing insight into my strategies and problem-solving techniques.

## How to Navigate
Feel free to explore my solutions for inspiration and learning. While you're welcome to review and study my solutions, I encourage you to engage with the problems yourself before consulting my code. This repository is intended to facilitate learning and growth, so I recommend using it as a reference rather than a direct source of answers.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized according to problem difficulty and category. Here's the structure:

<pre>

/LeetCode
│
├── Easy
│   ├── Arrays-Strings
│   │   ├── Problem1
│   │   │   ├── Solution.swift
│   │   │   └── Explanation.md
│   │   ├── Problem2

└── README.md

</pre>

Each problem folder contains a Solution.swift file with the Swift code for solving the problem, along with an Explanation.md file detailing the approach I adopted. The current README.md file offers an overview of the entire repository.

## Solution Approach
For every problem, I provide a detailed explanation of the methodology I employed to devise a solution. This includes discussions about algorithms, data structures, and any relevant insights. My aim is not only to offer solutions but also to help you comprehend the underlying concepts that can be applied to similar challenges.

## Contributions
Although this repository predominantly features my personal solutions, I'm open to contributions from the community. If you have more efficient solutions, different perspectives, or explanations for problems I haven't covered yet, please consider submitting a pull request. Kindly adhere to the existing format to maintain consistency.
